
✅ **Task 3 Completed** – This is part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

In this project, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the **UCI Repository** to predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their details.

## 📁 About the Project

- Used a real-world dataset with info like age, job, marital status, contact type, and more.
- Goal: Predict if a person will say **"yes"** or **"no"** to a marketing offer.
- Applied machine learning to train and test a **Decision Tree model**.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for charts and plots)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 What I Did

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset  
- Explored the data with graphs and summaries  
- Converted text data into numbers (encoding)  
- Trained the model using `DecisionTreeClassifier`  
- Checked how well it performed using accuracy and confusion matrix  
- Visualized the decision tree  

## 📌 What I Learned

- How Decision Trees work in ML  
- How to handle and prepare real datasets  
- How to evaluate ML models  
- Importance of data visualization
